## About Me
My name is Amy.  I've been a developer for more than 25 years.  I'm primarily a backend PHP developer, but dabble a bit in JavaScript from time to time. I love writing code that people use. 

## My Current Projects
- I'm a big fan of Obsidian.md. I've been dabbling a bit in plugin development.  
- I'm learning API-Platform, React, and React Native for a personal project
