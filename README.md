## About Me
My name is Amy.  I've been a developer for more than 25 years.  I'm primarily a backend PHP developer, but dabble a bit in JavaScript from time to time. I love writing code that people use. 

## My Current Projects
- I'm having fun playing with static site generators while working on https://amykhar.dev 
- My day job has been insanely busy lately, so not much personal coding going on.
